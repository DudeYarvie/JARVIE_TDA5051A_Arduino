Arduino library for JARVIE TDA5051A Home Automation Modem
# JARVIE TDA5051A Power-Line Modem Demo Board

This is a demonstration board for the NXP TDA5051A home automation modem. Couple this modem with any microcontroller project to bi-directionally communicate with other devices or systems over a shared power-bus. Said another way, the modem enables communication over the same wires that are used to power the system.
